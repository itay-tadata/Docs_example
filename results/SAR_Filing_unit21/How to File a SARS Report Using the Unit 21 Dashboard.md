## Introduction
The Unit 21 dashboard is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). This article will guide you through the step-by-step process of filing a SARS using the Unit 21 dashboard.

## Step 1: Accessing the Cases Tab
1. Log in to the Unit 21 dashboard.
2. On the left-hand side of the dashboard, you will see a tab called "Cases." Click on this tab to access the case management functionality.
3. The cases can be generated from alerts or created manually. For the purpose of this demonstration, we will select a pre-made case.

## Step 2: Reviewing the Case Information
1. Once you have selected the case, you will see the case management layout, which contains relevant information for the SARS filing process.
2. This layout includes associated tags, watchers, alerts, entities, and events related to the case.
3. You can add additional information, such as documents or notes, during the investigation process.
4. The alerts, entities, and events displayed in the summary are the ones associated with the case.

## Step 3: Initiating the SARS Filing
1. On the right-hand side of the case management page, you will see an action trigger to create a SARS.
2. Click on this action trigger to redirect you to the SARS filing layout.

## Step 4: Populating the SARS Filing
1. The SARS filing layout is divided into five steps.
2. Steps 1, 2, and 5 can be pre-filled using a template, which can be configured in the settings.
3. In Step 3, the individual's subject information, such as name, date of birth, gender, phone number, and email, will be pre-populated based on the data associated with the case.
4. In Step 4, the "Suspicious Activity" section, the aggregate events amount, start date, and end date will be automatically populated based on the events associated with the case.
5. You can continue filling out the remaining details in the SARS filing.

## Step 5: Validating and Submitting the SARS
1. Once you have completed the SARS filing, click on the "Validate" button to check for any missing required information.
2. Any missing information will be highlighted with red X's, which you can then address.
3. After ensuring all required information is provided, click on the "Ready for Review" button to finalize and submit the SARS report.
