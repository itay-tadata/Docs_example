# Configuring SARS Narratives in the Unit 21 Dashboard

## Introduction
The Unit 21 dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to configure SARS (Suspicious Activity Report) narratives. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and customize SARS narratives within the dashboard.

## Accessing the SARS Filing Section
1. Log in to the Unit 21 dashboard.
2. Locate the 'Settings' tab on the left side of the dashboard.
3. Click on the 'SARS Filing' section within the Settings tab.

## Configuring SARS Narratives
1. In the SARS Filing section, you will see several categories, including 'Financial Institution Type', 'Regulator', 'Filer Name', and form field information.
2. You can select the appropriate values for these fields to pre-populate the SARS filing information.
3. The narrative section allows for more customization. You can create default narratives and associate them with specific tags.
4. To add a new tag and narrative, click the 'Add New' button in the Narratives section.
5. Enter a name for the new tag (e.g., 'Account Type Verified') and the corresponding narrative text.

## Applying Narratives to SARS Filings
1. When creating a new case in the Unit 21 dashboard, you can associate it with the relevant tag(s).
2. When generating a SARS filing for the case, the system will automatically apply the narrative associated with the tag(s).
3. If no tag is associated with the case, the default SARS narrative will be used.

## Editing Existing Narratives
1. To modify an existing narrative, navigate to the SARS Filing section within the Settings tab.
2. Locate the narrative you want to edit and click on the pencil icon to enter edit mode.
3. Make the necessary changes to the narrative text and click 'Save' to apply the updates.
